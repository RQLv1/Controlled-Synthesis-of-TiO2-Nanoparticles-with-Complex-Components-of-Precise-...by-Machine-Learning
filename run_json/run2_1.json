The emulsion copolymerizations of St and VIMZ were also carried out in the presence of emulsifier. For this purpose, all ingredients are added into a 200-mL bottle and then the bottle was purged with nitrogen for 1 min. Right after this, the bottle prepared was capped and then tumbled at 70\u00b0C and a speed of 30 rpm for 18 h. Samples C03-12 and C05-06 exhibited a narrow particle size distribution. Samples C03-12 and C05-06 were repeated to prepare the seed particles on a large scale (i.e., R03-12 and R05-06, respectively) to study the imidazole-functionalized shell growth reaction. Several modes of monomer addition (without using any additional surfactants in the second-stage reaction) were explored to determine the conditions necessary for the effective incorporation of the imidazole groups onto the surface of seed particles. The solids content of the seed particles, R03-12, was 9.74 wt %.

In the case of V150-C, all of the second-stage monomers were added just before the second-stage polymerization process was begun.
