The emulsion copolymerizations of St and VIMZ were also carried out in the presence of emulsifier. For this purpose, all ingredients are added into a 200-mL bottle and then the bottle was purged with nitrogen for 1 min. Right after this, the bottle prepared was capped and then tumbled at 70\u00b0C and a speed of 30 rpm for 18 h. Samples C03-12 and C05-06 exhibited a narrow particle size distribution. Samples C03-12 and C05-06 were repeated to prepare the seed particles on a large scale (i.e., R03-12 and R05-06, respectively) to study the imidazole-functionalized shell growth reaction. Several modes of monomer addition (without using any additional surfactants in the second-stage reaction) were explored to determine the conditions necessary for the effective incorporation of the imidazole groups onto the surface of seed particles. The solids content of the seed particles, R03-12, was 9.74 wt %.

In the case of V150-C, all of the second-stage monomers were added just before the second-stage polymerization process was begun.

For example, 2 ml of titanium isopropoxide (TIP) (Alpha Aesar, 97%) was measured under nitrogen into a 50 ml flask. The flask was placed in a room temperature water bath, and 30 ml anhydrous ethanol (Fisher) was rapidly added while stirring, at which point fine white precipitates often formed in the clear solution. 0.15 ml acetic acid (Aldrich, 99.8%) was added, and the solution was left stirring rapidly until the precipitates dissolved and the solution was clear and colorless (5\u201310 min). 8 ml of aqueous H2O2 (Fisher, 34\u201337%) was then added, resulting in a bright orange, transparent solution. Total solution volume was filled to 50 ml with EtOH, and the flask was capped with a rubber stopper containing a small hole to allow for oxygen evolution with minimum solvent loss. The solution was stirred at room temperature for various times between 15 min and 7 h. The solution slowly changed from orange to transparent yellow over approximately 5 h reaction time. The solution was reacted at room temperature for 5\u20137 h prior to any aging. The above solution was aged at 75\u00b0C for various periods of time (0\u2013120 h). After 30 min of heating, the solution became translucent yellow and noticeably more viscous. After approximately 60 min at temperature, an opaque, pale yellow gel had formed. Films deposited from fresh solution were made during the initial reaction period, prior to any aging. Films deposited from aged solution were made after the amount of aging indicated in the text. Glass cover slips were used as substrates for film deposition. Substrates were cleaned prior to use by washing with detergent and rinsing with deionized water, followed by sonicating for 15 min in acetone and drying at 100\u00b0C. Thin films were deposited from fresh solution through spin-coating. Thick films made from aged solution were deposited through a simple doctor blade method. In brief, scotch tape was placed on the substrates to form a channel of uniform thickness. A small amount of viscous sol-gel solution was then placed in the channel and smoothed in with the edge of a glass microscope slide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Siemens D500 using CuK\u03b1 radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was done on an Avatar 370 FTIR. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken on a Digital Instruments Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope 3A Scanner Controller in tapping mode. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was done on a Brookhaven Instruments BI-9000AT Digital Autocorrelator with a BI-200SM Goniometer.

After stirring for 30 min, the catalyst solution of methanol, H2O and HNO3 was added to the TNB solution under continuous stirring. The solution gelled in 2 min. The wet gel, 4.5 cm in diameter and 5.5 cm high, was aged at room temperature for 1 day, and placed in a supercritical extraction system (Supercritical Fluid Extraction System, Newport Scientific Inc.). The solvent was extracted by flowing supercritical carbon dioxide with a flow rate of 5.5 l min\u22121 at 60\u00b0C and 22 MPa for 4 h (\u201caerogel\u201d, Figure 1). The corresponding xerogel was prepared by drying the aged wet gel at 90\u00b0C for 24 h under atmospheric pressure. Changes in the microstructure of the gels during heating were investigated using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA).

Nano-sized TiO2 was synthesized by the sol\u2013gel combustion synthesis reaction of titanyl nitrate [TiO(NO3)2] (oxidizer) and urea(CH4ON2) (fuel). Titanyl nitrate was prepared by first hydrolysis and then nitration of titanium n-butoxide (Ti (OC4H9)4). In a typical experiment, 1 mL Ti (OC4H9)4 was added slowly to 4.5 mL IPA (isopropyl alcohol, C2H4OHCH3) in a constant temperature bath at 273 K to form solution A. Meanwhile, 0.37 mL deionized water was added to another 4.5 mL IPA to form solution B. Solution B was then added dropwise to solution A under a vigorous stirring in the same constant temperature bath. The solution thus obtained was continuously stirred for about 1 h until the formation of titanyl hydroxide [TiO(OH)2] (indicated by the appearance of turbidity). For the nitration reaction, this solution was added with 0.37 mL 37 wt% nitric acid to produce titanyl nitrate[TiO(NO3)2]. The titanyl nitrate (in a solution state) thus obtained was mixed with various amounts of urea to form precursor solutions for the combustion synthesis reaction. The precursor solution (contained in an alumina crucible) was heated on a hot plate at *100\u00b0C to remove the solvent until a viscous mass was obtained. The combustion synthesis reaction was ignited by heating the viscous mass with a heating band set at 400\u00b0C, which was wrapped round the crucible in order to increase uniformity of the heating.

The molar ratio of the precursor solution was 6.5 TEOS:1CTAB:404 H2O. With the addition of the HCl, the solution became clear. A vibrating membrane sonicator was used to generate aerosol droplets which where then passed into a furnace.
