Several modes of monomer addition (without using any additional surfactants in the second-stage reaction) were explored to determine the conditions necessary for the effective incorporation of the imidazole groups onto the surface of seed particles.

Neutron diffraction is used to probe the structural changes in the lithiated TiO2, while NMR spectroscopy provides insights into the Li-ion dynamics and local environment. The study focuses on the differences in phase composition, morphology, and electronic configurations between nano- and micro-structured anatase TiO2.",
