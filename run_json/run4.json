The flask was placed in a room temperature water bath, and 30 ml anhydrous ethanol (Fisher) was rapidly added while stirring, at which point fine white precipitates often formed in the clear solution. 0.15 ml acetic acid (Aldrich, 99.8%) was added, and the solution was left stirring rapidly until the precipitates dissolved and the solution was clear and colorless (5–10 min). 8 ml of aqueous H2O2 (Fisher, 34–37%) was then added, resulting in a bright orange, transparent solution. Total solution volume was filled to 50 ml with EtOH, and the flask was capped with a rubber stopper containing a small hole to allow for oxygen evolution with minimum solvent loss. The solution was stirred at room temperature for various times between 15 min and 7 h. The solution slowly changed from orange to transparent yellow over approximately 5 h reaction time. The solution was reacted at room temperature for 5–7 h prior to any aging. The above solution was aged at 75°C for various periods of time (0–120 h). After 30 min of heating, the solution became translucent yellow and noticeably more viscous. After approximately 60 min at temperature, an opaque, pale yellow gel had formed. Films deposited from fresh solution were made during the initial reaction period, prior to any aging. Films deposited from aged solution were made after the amount of aging indicated in the text. Glass cover slips were used as substrates for film deposition. Substrates were cleaned prior to use by washing with detergent and rinsing with deionized water, followed by sonicating for 15 min in acetone and drying at 100°C.

After stirring for 30 min, the catalyst solution of methanol, H2O and HNO3 was added to the TNB solution under continuous stirring. The solution gelled in 2 min. The wet gel, 4.5 cm in diameter and 5.5 cm high, was aged at room temperature for 1 day, and placed in a supercritical extraction system (Supercritical Fluid Extraction System, Newport Scientific Inc.). The solvent was extracted by flowing supercritical carbon dioxide with a flow rate of 5.5 l min−1 at 60°C and 22 MPa for 4 h (“aerogel”, Figure 1). The corresponding xerogel was prepared by drying the aged wet gel at 90°C for 24 h under atmospheric pressure. Changes in the microstructure of the gels during heating were investigated using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The TG-DTA measurements were carried out using a Seiko Exstar 6000 TG/DTA 6200 System under flowing air of 300 ml min−1 at a heating rate of 10°C min−1.

In a typical experiment, 1 mL Ti (OC4H9)4 was added slowly to 4.5 mL IPA (isopropyl alcohol, C2H4OHCH3) in a constant temperature bath at 273 K to form solution A. Meanwhile, 0.37 mL deionized water was added to another 4.5 mL IPA to form solution B. Solution B was then added dropwise to solution A under a vigorous stirring in the same constant temperature bath.

The combustion synthesis reaction was ignited by heating the viscous mass with a heating band set at 400°C, which was wrapped round the crucible in order to increase uniformity of the heating. A pale yellow, foam type TiO2 powder was produced after the combustion synthesis reaction. Although the combustion synthesis reaction can self-sustain, the heating was maintained after ignition in order to enhance the crystallization of the product powder.",

Argon and a small amount of oxygen were used as the working gas and reactive gas, respectively. The aggregation chamber was connected to the main chamber via an orifice. The pressure in the aggregation source was set between 50 and 200 Pa, and the argon and oxygen flow rates were controlled using mass flow controllers. The deposition rate was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance, and the evolution of cluster deposition was monitored for 25–45 minutes. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to monitor the oxygen molecules escaped from the aggregation chamber. Samples for cluster size evaluation were prepared on silicon substrates and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.",

The solution was transferred to a polypropylene bottle and kept under static conditions for 8 h at 80 °C, then cooled to room temperature and maintained at this temperature for 15 h. The sample was vacuum dried, calcined in air at 500 °C for 12 h, with a 5 °C/min ramp rate, to burn oﬀ the surfactant. SBA-15, SBA-11, and SBA-12 were synthesized using the method developed by Zhao et al. [9]. The sample labeled SBA-15/2 was prepared using the same precursor solution as that used for SBA-15, but the mixture was kept at 35 °C for 20 h, and then at 80 °C for 8 h, followed by 35 °C for 15 h. The higher temperature allowed us to obtain larger sized pores while keeping the same pore structure. HMM-2 was synthesized by the method developed by Inagaki et al. [10]. The aerosol-derived silica is prepared by using CTAB as a templating surfactant and TEOS as a silica source. The CTAB was dissolved in DI water under mild heating conditions. TEOS is added to the surfactant solution followed by 1 ml of 1 N HCl to assist with CTAB/TEOS electrostatic interactions and to slow the rate of silica gelation. The molar ratio of the precursor solution was 6.5 TEOS:1CTAB:404 H2O. With the addition of the HCl, the solution became clear. A vibrating membrane sonicator was used to generate aerosol droplets which where then passed into a furnace. N2 gas, with a flow rate of 2 SLPM, was used to carry the aerosolized solution through a three-zone tube furnace set at a temperature of 125 °C.
